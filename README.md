# PhaseAwareLSTM
PhaseAwareLSTM provides a minimal, self-contained MATLAB implementation of projection-based transfer learning for low-channel EEG decoding.   The code accompanies the corresponding research work and focuses on clarity, reproducibility, and simplicity rather than full-scale dataset distribution.
